AVL trees are suitable for database indexing where frequent searches are common and performance is critical because of its balance.
Time Complexity:
Insertion, Deletion, and Search: O(log‚Å°n) time, this efficiency is due to the tree maintaining a balance, ensured by rebalancing (rotations) after insertions and deletions.
Rotations: Each insertion and deletion may require at most O(1) rotations (specifically, up to 2), which is minimal and ensures the tree remains balanced.
Space Complexity:
AVL trees have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes. This is due to the storage of nodes, each containing data, two child pointers, and a height attribute.

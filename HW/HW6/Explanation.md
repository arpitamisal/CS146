Solutions:

1. Brute Force: Find a pair then add the third element one by one until you find an answer, if you donâ€™t then move to the next number for the 2nd element and then do the same. Time Comp: O(n^3)
2. Hashset: If our array has less than 3 elements, return empty list, then first sort your array, then create a hashset, results, then have a for loop from 0 to length -2 and create 2 pointers, left = i+1 and right = length - 1, then have a while loop until left is less than right, then have a value sum where arr[i] + arr[left] + arr[right], and if the sum == 0 then add the result into the hashset, then increment left and right, and if the sum is less than 0 then increment only left, else increment only right, then at the end return new ArrayList<>(result), TIME COMP= O(n^2)

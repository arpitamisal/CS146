We can perform a level order traversal on a binary search tree by processing processes the nodes of the tree level by level, from the top down and from left to right within each level. To solve this problem, I followed this logic:
If the root is null, the binary tree is empty, and therefore, the result is an empty list or None.
Initialize an empty list to hold the results of the traversal.
Initialize a queue and enqueue the root node to start the level order traversal.
While the queue is not empty:
Determine the number of nodes at the current level (the size of the queue).
For each node at this level, dequeue it, capture its value, and enqueue its left and right children (if they exist).
After processing all nodes at the current level, add their values as a sub-list to the results list.
Return the list containing the values of all levels of the tree.
